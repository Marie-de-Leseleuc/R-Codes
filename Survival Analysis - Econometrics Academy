# Define variables

X <- cbind(logwage, ui, age)

# Descriptive statistics 
summary(time)
 # mean = 6.248 i.e. it takes people to find a job or leave the sample

summary(event)
 # mean = 0.321 i.e. 32% of people have experience the failure event (finding a job)

summary(coxph)
 # Coef xlogwage = 0.461553 i.e. higher logwages would have lower unemployment duration
 # coef Xui = -0.979578 i.e. those who have an insurace are likely to have longer unemployment duration

 # hazard rate xlogwage = 1.5865 i.e. 1 unit increasing of logwage is associated with 58% increase in the hazard rate
 # hazard rate xui = 0.3755 i.e. 0.3755 - 1 = 62% decrease in the hazard rate 
 # The higher the hazard rate, the more likely the event will occur (i.e. finding a job)

# Exponential, Weibull, and log-logistic parametric model coeficients
# opposite signs from stata results, weibull results differ; Same as SAS

 # NOTE: results are opposite to Cox! Be careful when interpretating the results
