# Residuals vs. Fitted = fitted value vs. distance of each point to regression line.
# The plot is used to detect non-linearity, unequal error variances, and outliers.
# the residual = 0 line corresponds to the estimated regression line.

# Here are the characteristics of a well-behaved residual vs. fits plot and what they suggest 
# about the appropriateness of the simple linear regression model:
  
# The residuals "bounce randomly" around the 0 line. This suggests that the assumption that the relationship is 
 # linear is reasonable.
# The residuals roughly form a "horizontal band" around the 0 line. This suggests that the variances of the error terms 
 # are equal.
# No one residual "stands out" from the basic random pattern of residuals. This suggests that there are no outliers.

# Q(uantile) - Q(uantile) plot = graphical tool to help us assess if a set of data plausibly came 
  # from some theoretical distribution such as a Normal or exponential
# A Q-Q plot is a scatterplot created by plotting two sets of quantiles against one another. 
# If both sets of quantiles came from the same distribution, we should see the points forming a line thatâ€™s roughly 
  # straight.
  # i.e. if want to test if data is coming from a normal dist., compare quantiles from theorical normal dist. 
  # and compare them to the quantiles from your dist. to see if correspond. 
#Q-Q plots take your sample data, sort it in ascending order, and then plot them versus quantiles calculated 
  # from a theoretical distribution. The number of quantiles is selected to match the size of your sample data.
